Rajpoot, ”Locality Sensitive Deep Learning for Detection and Classification of Nuclei in Routine Colon Cancer Histology Images,” in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, vol. 35, no. 5, pp. 1196-1206, May 2016, doi: 10.1109/TMI.2016.2525803.

    - Baseline: Spatially Constrained CNN (SC-CNN)
        - Purpose: Detect the centers of nuclei in histopathology images without requiring prior segmentation.​
        - Input: Image patches centered around each pixel
        - Output: A probability map indicating the likelihood of each pixel being at the center of a nucleus.
        - Spatial Constraint: The network is trained to produce high probabilities only in the vicinity of actual nucleus centers, reducing false positives.
        - Architecture: A convolutional neural network designed to regress the likelihood of nucleus centers, incorporating spatial constraints to enhance detection accuracy.​
    
    - 2nd model: Neighbouring Ensemble Model (NEP) 
        - Purpose: Classify detected nuclei into one of four categories: epithelial, inflammatory, fibroblast, or miscellaneous.​
        - Input: Features extracted from the detected nucleus and its neighboring nuclei.
        - Ensemble Approach: Combines predictions from multiple classifiers, each considering different neighborhood configurations, to improve robustness.
        - Integration with SC-CNN: Utilizes the detections from SC-CNN to define the regions of interest for classification.
    
    - Performance Metric: Achieved an average F1 score of 0.775, outperforming other contemporary methods.
    Notable Advantage: The combined approach of SC-CNN and NEP eliminates the need for explicit nucleus segmentation, streamlining the analysis pipeline.​
